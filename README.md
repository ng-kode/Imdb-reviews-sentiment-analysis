# Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Movie Reviews

In this respository, we will explore one way of applying machine learning technique to real-life data.
In this example, given 25,000 **labelled** IMDb reviews, we will **classify** each review to be either **positive or negative**.

## Overview

- All 25,000 reviews are pre-labelled with either positive or negative
- 25,000 reviews to train our model (i.e. provide the model with **both text and label** for it to learn)
- 25,000 reviews to test our model (i.e. provide the model with **text only**, the model predict if each review is positive or negative)

Our model can attain:
  - Accuracy of 88.6% (total number of correct predictions / 25,000 reviews)
  - Precision of 89.4% (total number of correct predictions / total number of predictions)
  - Recall of 88.0% and 90% (total number of reviews predicted as positive /  total number of positive reviews, and vice versa)
